Final Project Reflection
------------------------

This is the hardest coding project I have done in my life. It was the strongest emphasis
I could have received about modularity when building large projects. Milestone 1 and 2
were fairly harmless even though I wasn't quite sure how they tied into the larger
picture of a line manager, but milestone 3 broke my brain and rebuilt it multiple times.
I was terrified at building the LineManager constructor and rightly so, it took me multiple
days just to understand half the code I was writing for it. The sort function was easier
than it looked, and the run() function really gave me a run for my money.

The hardest part of the function was really figuring out what it was supposed to do
because the instructions were incredibly vague, and most of the interpretation had to
come from the output that wasn't exactly explicit in how it got to the end result. I 
would say that to get run to work how it was supposed to was more experimentation on
where to put for_each loops and seeing if it gave me an output that resembled the expected
one, more than my understanding.

Overall, every module but the LineManager was easier to code because they are all
fairly independent of each other. However, since LineManager ties them all together
with too many layers of inheritance, it was a very large struggle, especially because
the instructions were needlessly vague and hard to understand.
