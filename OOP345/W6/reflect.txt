Workshop 6 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 6 I really tried to use iterators to work through the vector, however I couldn't
figure out how to use the iterators since the vector we were working with contained pointers,
making it really convoluted to dereference when I needed to access the values and I still
haven't found a way to achieve. 

We have to deallocate the memory in the vector because the objects inside the vector don't
have their own destructor, so if not destructed in the vector it would cause a memory leak.

However, in this workshop I think my biggest struggle was with input and sanitizing it so that it
fit into my variables. All of the variation in the messy data file meant a lot of extra
duct tape was needed to make it work and give off exceptions properly.
