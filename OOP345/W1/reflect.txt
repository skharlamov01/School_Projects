Workshop 1 Reflection
---------------------
Workshop 1 was not too hard, and as such it was a really good refresher coming back into
C++ from OOP244. The rule of 3 was very useful to remember, even though I definitely had
to pull up my old projects for reference. All in all, a very nice reminder for the 
upcoming semester.
