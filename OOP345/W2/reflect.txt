Workshop 2 Reflection
---------------------
This workshop made me have to really use my brain to start understanding the two new
additions to the rule of 3 (now rule of 5). The move functionality is overall a far
easier way to copy objects to new variable names, especially computationally as this
workshop demonstrated through the use of a manual timer on the computations. I still 
don't feel like I'm on solid footing quite yet, but this was also a very good reminder
on dynamic memory, and especially dynamic arrays (which aren't exactly different than
a dynamic string, but my mind still regards them differently). This workshop also
really forced me to read the terrible, dry documentation to actually understand what
was going on in libraries I'm not used to, which is a good skill to learn I assume.
