Workshop 9 Reflection
---------------------

This was by far one of the hardest workshops to understand. Multithreading itself
was not a difficult concept but understanding the code that was given to us really
put my reading comprehension to the test more than any other workshop.

I don't think there was any benefit to the binary files other than teaching us that
apparently reading binary in C++ is incredibly inconvenient. Now I know how to do it,
and I hope I never have to.

I could see the use of binding a function if you want the same variable to be a parameter,
it lessens the amount of writing to do when you call the function for the thread, making
the thread parameter list more readable.

If you know how to use multi-threading and how to organize that mess with futures and
locks and atomics, that would be a massive boost to processing speed and memory management.
In my code I just did simple multi-threading, nothing special.
I created a thread object with the bound function and then used std::move() to move
that thread into my vector of threads. After, I just looped through the vector and joined
them.
