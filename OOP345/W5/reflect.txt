Workshop 5 Reflection
---------------------
These workshops are getting really hard to keep up with. The concepts like Lambda
functions, functors, and the in-depth templating are incredibly abstract and leave
me feeling like I've done black magic at the completion of a workshop. This workshop
was very heavy on teaching us functors, lambda expressions, and error handling. Out of 
the three, I found error handling the easiest to deal with by far. I couldn't
tell you the different utilizations between functors and lambda expressions very well,
I've only managed to see a similarity between lambda and anonymous functions in 
JavaScript, which have some very convenient uses where you don't really want to name
the function. In terms of the classes of Book and Movie, I'd probably make Book a child
class of Movie since their functionalities are effectively the same, Book just contains
more variables. I think default constructors are almost always necessary to ensure your
classes are in a safe state when working with them and to make sure your IDE doesn't 
throw a fit about it.
