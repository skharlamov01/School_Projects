Workshop 1 Reflection
---------------------
In this workshop I have learned how to functionally use the namespace feature
alongside the new I/O method in c++, "cout" and "cin". I have also learned that
c++ has the new integral type of "bool" which makes it significantly more clear
in my case when making flags for loops, rather than using integers ones and zeros.
The main struggle that I have at the moment is that I don't have enough context 
at the moment to understand when to use any of these concepts (namespace, iostream,
cout vs. printf). I'm hoping as the course progresses, I learn a bit more context
of when and how I should be using these new object-oriented concepts.
