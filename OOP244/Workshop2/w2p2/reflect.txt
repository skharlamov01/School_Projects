Workshop 2 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 2, dynamic memory was heavily emphasized, especially alongside structs and
array. In part 2, there was a nice little refresher on using a sorting algorithm 
and more dealing with reading from files. This all cumulated in me really having a better
grasp on how memory management works in c++. For example, I really struggled with the
concept that if you create a char pointer to hold a string, that does not actually 
allocate physical memory, only creates an address, and you have to manually allocate
exactly how much memory you know you need for it. This took me a few days to really
wrap my head around, and I can't say I fully understand it but I'm definitely on the way
to understanding.
