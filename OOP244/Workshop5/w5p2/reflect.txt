Workshop 5 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 5, there was an emphasis on type and operator overloading. I found the 
concept fairly easy to understand, but the implementation was confusing. Reading
through the notes, I didn't find a clear-cut way to format the code, so I had
to conduct a bit of trial and error, alongside googling. I particularly struggled
with when to typecast using my custom type overloads. Overall, this workshop
was fairly easy and a great entry into operator overloading, as well as more 
practice with using current object.
