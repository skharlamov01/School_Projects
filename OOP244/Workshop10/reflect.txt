Workshop 10 Reflection
---------------------
While workshop 10 introduced a completely new concept (templates), I did not
struggle with it as much as previous workshops. I am unsure if this is because
of my growth in understanding over the semester or pure luck, but utilizing the
templates only required a little bit of code reading and tampering with code
format to ensure that it compiled properly. I had no memory issues, the syntax,
while confusing, was not complex, but it was definitely odd to return by copy
after spending the whole semester returning by reference.
Overall, a nice and quick little workshop that was a solid introduction to templates
for the end of the semester.

/*For the select function, each object with a class type needs to
	have an '==' operator overload that allows the class to be compared
	with another class of the same type. Similarly, each object needs to
	have an '=' operator overload that functions as a fool-proof
	assignment operator for the object.*/
/*for the printCollection function, an object of the class type
	needs to have a function called size() that returns the size of the
	array through which to loop. The object also needs to have a 
	'<<' operator override that defines the display of the object to 
	the output stream.*/
