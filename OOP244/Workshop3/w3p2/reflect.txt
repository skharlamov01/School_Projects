Workshop 3 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 3, classes and privacy were highlighted. This forced me to start getting
really familiar with how classes and objects worked in C++. It was definitely tricky,
and I still have a hard time visualizing it sometimes. However my overall understanding
of objects and how to use them has improved greatly. I particularly struggled with 
the idea that member function implementation does not need you to reference the class
in the same way that a struct might, because I had been using structs as a sort of 
scaffolding for my understanding of objects/classes so far. In this way, this workshop
has really helped me update my understanding of classes.
