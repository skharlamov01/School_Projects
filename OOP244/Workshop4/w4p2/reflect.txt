Workshop 4 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 4, there was an emphasis on constructors and destructors. The concept was
not too hard to pick up as opposed to some of the previous workshops, however I did 
run into some run-order issues. The implementation was easy enough, the issue came
about when everything was pretty much ready. I would run the code and it would throw
me an error right at the main() return. This threw me for a loop, and after a lot of
irritated bug testing I found out that my building a little function to display the
robot control room summary was messing up the whole destruction. Since the robot
being passed was in the middle of the robot array, when it figured that it was time
to destruct the robot at the end of the summary function, that meant that when the 
main array destruction happened, the computer found that the robot at index 4 was 
already destructed and thus threw an error that there was nothing to destruct.
