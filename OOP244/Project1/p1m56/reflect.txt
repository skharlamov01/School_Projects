Final Project Reflection
------------------------
My final solution is functional, which provides me with some relief. I honestly found
this last project to be the most do-able and least abstract workshop of them all.
I didn't really struggle with anything specifically, just some memory issues and
bug-hunting. I'd like to think this is thanks to the rest of the semester being
an intangible mess in my brain that refused to make sense, and I'm still not quite
sure how it all came together at the end here.

In this final solution, I found that my understanding of pointers and dereferencing
definitely increased. Alongside, this was a really good foundation to work with 
the I/O stream, be it in console or file. I did struggle initially with pointers
and dereferencing, but some quick school notes and advice was very helpful to 
clarify. Overall, this was very similar to the big menu we built in IPC with some
added object-oriented concepts, and a really good way for me to utilize many of the
object-oriented concepts taught this semester.
