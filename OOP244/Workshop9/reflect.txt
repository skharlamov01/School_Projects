Workshop 9 Reflection
---------------------
I really struggled with workshop 9. I still don't have a full grasp on virtual functions,
but luckily file reading is not too different than regular input/output. The struggle
with workshop 9 came in the form of the valgrind check. I was having a particular issue
with the valgrind returning that there were uninitialized variables being used in a 
conditional move. So, I did a quick google and found the "track-origins=yes" option
that can be added. That helped me figure out what was being used, but it was a real
pain to find out that the entire issue was caused by my write function for-loop in my
Text class. I had the for-loop set to run "i < fsize - 1" because that was the only way
it gave me the correct output in the local compiler. However, apparently this caused an
issue with the linux compiler and reading the file, so setting it to just "i < fsize"
fixed the entire thing. At the end of the day, frustrating as it is, this workshop
continued to reinforce my understanding of how memory management works in c++.
