Workshop 7 Reflection
---------------------
In workshop 7 and the milestones, I have not struggled too much. I understand the main
concepts, and certainly enough to implement the projects, but I have not had enough
time this semester to really get into the meat and potatoes of how things work under
the hood. There was a bit of a struggle in the beginning on trying to understand
class inheritance and the difference between creating a public method and
designating a child class as having public access to the parent class. All in all,
this workshop and the milestones have been a great way to reinforce the new
object-oriented concepts that I have learned this semester so far.
